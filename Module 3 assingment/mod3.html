        He heard quiet steps behind him. That didn't bode well. Who could be following him this late at night and in
        this deadbeat part of town? And at this particular moment, just after he pulled off the big time and was making
        off with the greenbacks. Was there another crook who'd had the same idea, and was now watching him and waiting
        for a chance to grab the fruit of his labour? Or did the steps behind him mean that one of many law officers in
        town was on to him and just waiting to pounce and snap those cuffs on his wrists? He nervously looked all
        around. Suddenly he saw the alley. Like lightning he darted off to the left and disappeared between the two
        warehouses almost falling over the bin lying in the middle of the pavement. He tried to nervously tap his way
        along in the inky darkness and suddenly stiffened: it was a dead-end, he would have to go back the way he had
        come. The steps got louder and louder, he saw the black outline of a figure coming around the corner. Is this
        the end of the line? he thought pressing himself back against the wall trying to make himself invisible in the
        dark, was all that planning and energy wasted? He was dripping with sweat now, cold and wet, he could smell the
        fear coming off his clothes. Suddenly next to him, with a barely noticeable squeak, a door swung quietly to and
        fro in the night's breeze. Could this be the haven he'd prayed for? Slowly he slid toward the door, pressing
        himself more and more into the wall, into the dark, away from his enemy. Would this door save his hide?He heard
